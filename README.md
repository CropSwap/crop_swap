# CropSwap

## Description

Every year, over 6 billion pounds of fresh produce in the United States goes unsold or unharvested. CropSwap alleviates food waste by enabling growers to swap their excess crops with one another, and by allowing responsible consumers to swap their time or labor for a grower's excess crops.

CropSwap - connecting neighbors to neighbors through food.

## Features

On CropSwap, a grower can post any excess crop s/he would like to swap. Other users can propose swaps for time, labor, or other crops. Swaps are accepted or rejected, and growers are connected with each other!
